You wake up in your studio. You feel tired. Sun is coming from the window.

Studio
The studio is messed up, still quite clean. The only forniture in the room is a bed, and a table with a comfortable chair in front of it. There is a window on the north wall, and a door south.

You can see a window, a door to the stairs, a bed, a table (on which are a manual and a laptop) and a chair here.
